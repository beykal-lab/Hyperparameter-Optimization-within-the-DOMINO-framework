# Hyperparameter Optimization for Non-linear Machine Learning Models Within the DOMINO Framework 

## Overview

### The DOMINO Framework

- Data-driven Optimization of bilevel Mixed-Integer Non-linear problems
- This framework approximates the bilevel optimization problem as a single task and solves them using data-driven optimization algorithms
- Because of the flexibility of the framework, a wide range of data-driven algorithms can be integerated to the framework
- Any solution returned  by the framework, are guaranteed to be feasible
- Hyperparameter optimization for ML models, is formulized as a bilevel optimization problem and can by solved within the DOMINO framework
